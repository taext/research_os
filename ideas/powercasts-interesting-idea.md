# PowerCasts

### What is the interesting idea in PowerCasts?

The interesting idea with PowerCasts is the ability to play random episodes from a full OPML podcast feed collection.

That is, it allows for a shuffle feature on the total sum of episodes, across podcasts, in an OPML collection. 

Or across the sum of new episodes, alternatively.

### TL;DR

Having a full list of podcast episode URLs is pretty neat.
